## Introduction
<QouteComponent> Tizen is a Linux-based mobile operating system backed by the Linux Foundation, mainly developed and used primarily by Samsung Electronics.</QouteComponent>

So not really, but when we speak about Tizen we have Samsung devices in mind, because as mentioned it is mainly used for developing Samsung applications.By Samsung devices we mean mobile, TV and wearable devices as mostly used with Tizen.

There are several ways you can update an XML file using the terminal or a bash script. Here are a few options:

## sed
Use sed: sed is a command-line tool that can be used to search and replace text in a file. You can use it to update an XML file by specifying the search pattern and the replacement text. For example:

```bash
sed -i 's/<old-text>/<new-text>/g' file.xml
```

This will search for all instances of `<old-text>` in file.xml and replace them with `<new-text>`.


## awk
Use awk: awk is a programming language designed for text processing. You can use it to update an XML file by specifying the search pattern and the replacement text. For example:

```bash
awk '/<old-text>/{sub("<old-text>","<new-text>")}1' file.xml > newfile.xml
```
This will search for all instances of `<old-text>` in file.xml and replace them with `<new-text>`, and write the updated content to a new file called newfile.xml.

## xmlstarlet
Use xmlstarlet: xmlstarlet is a command-line tool for working with XML files. You can use it to update an XML file by specifying the element you want to update and the new value. For example:

```bash
xmlstarlet ed -L -u '/root/element/@attribute' -v 'new value' file.xml
```
This will update the attribute of the element element under the root element in file.xml with the value new value.

<b>Note:</b> These are just a few examples of how you can update an XML file using the terminal or a bash script. There are many other tools and techniques you can use, depending on your specific needs.

## Use combination of sed and xmlstarlet 

To update an XML file from a bash script, you can use a combination of the sed command and the xmlstarlet utility. Here is an example of how this can be done:

First, make sure that the sed and xmlstarlet utilities are installed on your system.

Create a bash script and open it in a text editor.

Use the sed command to find and replace a specific string in the XML file. For example, the following command will replace the string "old_string" with "new_string" in the file "input.xml":

```bash
sed 's/old_string/new_string/g' input.xml > output.xml
```

Use the xmlstarlet utility to update specific elements or attributes in the XML file. For example, the following command will update the value of the "name" attribute in the "item" element to "new_name":

```bash
xmlstarlet ed -u '/items/item/@name' -v 'new_name' input.xml > output.xml
```

Save and close the bash script.

Run the bash script to update the XML file.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and you can use a combination of sed and xmlstarlet commands to update the XML file in more complex ways. You can also use other utilities such as awk or perl to manipulate the XML file in your bash script.

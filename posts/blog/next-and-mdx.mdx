## Introduction

Are you a developer looking to create a blog or personal website that is both easy to maintain and visually appealing? Look no further than using <Link href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</Link> and <Link href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</Link>!

<Adjusted>Next.js</Adjusted> is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications and in the past year my personal favorite  framework which I really love to use. It offers automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and a simple setup process. On the other hand, MDX is a format that allows you to write JSX in Markdown documents. This means you can include React components within your Markdown content, making it easy to create dynamic and interactive blog posts.

But what makes Next.js and MDX the perfect combination for a blog?

## Easy customization

With Next.js, you have complete control over the design of your site. It uses <Link href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</Link> for styling, which allows you to write actual CSS code within your JavaScript files. This means you can easily customize the appearance of your blog without having to navigate between multiple files.

Additionally, MDX allows you to import and use React components within your Markdown content. This means you can create custom blocks or components to include in your posts, such as code blocks, file uploads, or even interactive elements like charts or maps.

## SEO benefits

Server-rendered apps, like those built with Next.js, have an advantage when it comes to search engine optimization (SEO). Since the HTML for the page is generated on the server, search engines are able to easily index the content. This is especially important for a blog, where it is crucial for your articles to be easily discoverable.

## Speed and performance

Next.js automatically code splits your application, meaning that it only sends the JavaScript necessary for the current page to the browser. This results in faster page load times and a better user experience.

## In summary

Using Next.js and MDX for your blog allows for easy customization, improved SEO, and fast performance. Give it a try and see how it can take your blogging to the next level!

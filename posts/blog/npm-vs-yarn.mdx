## Introduction
<Link href='npmjs.com'>npm</Link> and <Link href='https://yarnpkg.com/'>Yarn</Link> are both popular package managers for JavaScript projects, but they have some key differences that you should be aware of when deciding which one to use.

## npm

npm (short for Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It is installed with Node.js and allows you to download and manage packages (libraries and tools) that you can use in your projects. npm uses a package.json file in the root of your project to keep track of the packages you have installed and their versions.

### Some notable features of npm

<LgList>
    <li>A registry of over 1 million packages that you can use in your projects</li>
    <li>Automatic dependency resolution, which means that npm will automatically install any dependencies (i.e. packages that your project relies on) that are required by your project</li>
    <li>A command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to manage your packages and run scripts</li>
</LgList>

## Yarn
Yarn is an alternative package manager that was developed by Facebook in collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde. Like npm, Yarn allows you to download and manage packages for your projects, but it has a few key differences that set it apart.

### Some notable features of Yarn

<LgList>
    <li>A faster installation process, thanks to its use of a lockfile and a cache</li>
    <li>The ability to install packages offline, as long as you have previously installed them on the same machine</li>
    <li>More reliable and deterministic installs, thanks to its use of a lockfile that specifies the exact versions of packages to be installed</li>
    <li>A CLI that is similar to that of npm, but with a few extra features (e.g. the ability to easily upgrade all packages in a project to their latest versions)</li>
</LgList>

## Which one should you use?

Ultimately, the choice between npm and Yarn depends on your personal preference and the needs of your project. Both package managers are widely used and have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are just starting out with JavaScript development, it might make sense to stick with npm, since it is the default package manager for Node.js and has a larger user base. On the other hand, if you are working on a larger project with a team and need a more reliable and deterministic way to manage your dependencies, Yarn might be a better choice.

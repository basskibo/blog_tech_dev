## Introduction

Classes are template used for creating objects, encapsulating data with code to work on that data.
Class in Javascript is built on prototype but also it has some syntax that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantic.
In the modern JavaScript, there’s a more advanced “class” construct, that introduces great new features which are useful for object-oriented programming.

## Defining JS class
Class can be regarded as a type of <Adjusted>function</Adjusted>, but instead of keyword function, which we normally use for initiate a function, we will use keyword <Adjusted>class</Adjusted> and the properties are assigned inside <Adjusted>constructor</Adjusted> method.



```js
class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}

```



## constructor()

The <Adjusted>constructor()</Adjusted> method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created within a class. Class can have only one constructor per class, 
so you will not be able to add multiple constructors to one Class and in case you do you will get SyntaxError.
This method will be called automatically when a class is initiated and it strictly needs to be named "constructor". In case you dont define constructor,
 Javascript will automatically add invisible and empty constructor method. 


```js
class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
}

```

## extends

The <Adjusted>extends</Adjusted> keyword is used to create a child class of another or parent class. This means that child class will inherit all methods from parent class.
This is useful for code reusability because reusing properties and methods of an already existing class can be really helpfull and we do not duplicate code unnseccarry.


```js
class Student extends User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, monthlySallary, user_class, grade) {
    super(firstName, lastName, age, monthlySallary);
    this.class = user_class;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}

```

## static

The <Adjusted>static</Adjusted> keyword define static methods for classes which are called directly on the class and not on the instance.
In order to call static method we do not need to create instance of the class in order to call static method as in case above.



```js
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  static hello() {  // static method
    return "Hello!!";
  }
}

mycar = new Car("Ford");

//Call 'hello()' on the class Car and NOT mycar
Car.hello();

```

## super

The <Adjusted>super</Adjusted> keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class in order to access parent properties and methods which are 
defined in constructor of the parent class. In order to understand better concept of the "inheritance" in Object oriented programming you can read this
<Link href="https://viktor-kukurba.medium.com/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript-2-inheritance-447368f57a26"> great article </Link>

``` js
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}

mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = mycar.show();
```

## Introduction

Here you will not find much

Just keep **looking**

## REST API

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. In a RESTful Web service, requests made to a resource's URI elicit a response with a payload formatted in HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format.

### REST API best practice

Some of the best practics for implmenting REST API are following:

<SmList>
    <li>Accept and response with JSON </li>
    <li>When returing error, use HTTP error codes and reason for fail </li>
    <li>Use plural when you naming collection of data </li>
    <li>Use resource nesting </li>
    <li>Secure API and use SSL/TLS </li>
    <li>Write documentation and explain what is expected behavior </li>

</SmList>

## Scaling

Scalability describes systems ability to be elastic, not just grow as it is usually said.

## Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing

### Encoding

In the Encoding method, data is transformed from one form to another. The main aim of encoding is to transform data into a form that is readable by most of the systems or that can be used by any external process.
It can’t be used for securing data, various publicly available algorithms are used for encoding.

Encoding can be used for reducing the size of audio and video files. Each audio and video file format has a corresponding coder-decoder (codec) program that is used to code it into the appropriate format and then decodes for playback.

Example: ASCII, BASE64, UNICODE

### Encryption

Encryption in encoding technique in which message is encoded by using encryption algorithm in such a way that only authorized personnel can access the message or information.

It is a special type of encoding that is used for transferring private data, for example sending a combination of username and password over the internet for email login.

In encryption, data to be encrypted(called plain-text) is transformed using an encryption algorithm like AES encryption or RSA encryption using a secret key called cipher. The encrypted data is called cipher-text, and finally, the secret key can be used by the intended recipient to convert it back to plain-text.

### Hashing

In hashing, data is converted to the hash using some hashing function, which can be any number generated from string or text. Various hashing algorithms are MD5, SHA256. Data once hashed is non-reversible.

## Authentication vs. Authorization

Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

### Authentication

Authentication is the act of validating that users are whom they claim to be. This is the first step in any security process.

Complete an authentication process with:

-  Passwords. Usernames and passwords are the most common authentication factors. If a user enters the correct data, the system assumes the identity is valid and grants access.
-  One-time pins. Grant access for only one session or transaction.
-  Authentication apps. Generate security codes via an outside party that grants access.
-  Biometrics. A user presents a fingerprint or eye scan to gain access to the system.

   In some instances, systems require the successful verification of more than one factor before granting access. This multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirement is often deployed to increase security beyond what passwords alone can provide.

### Authorization

Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.

Giving someone permission to download a particular file on a server or providing individual users with administrative access to an application are good examples of authorization.

In secure environments, authorization must always follow authentication. Users should first prove that their identities are genuine before an organization’s administrators grant them access to the requested resources.

## Git

### Merge vs Rebase

Reading the official Git manual it states that rebase “reapplies commits on top of another base branch”, whereas merge “joins two or more development histories together”. In other words, the key difference between merge and rebase is that while merge preserves history as it happened, rebase rewrites it.

### Entity–relationship model

Main article: Entity–relationship model
In software engineering, an entity–relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity–relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity–relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

### Domain model

Main article: Domain model
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the problem domain). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity–relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

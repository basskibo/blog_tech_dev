## Introduction

Here you will not find much

Just keep **looking**

## REST API

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. In a RESTful Web service, requests made to a resource's URI elicit a response with a payload formatted in HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format.

### REST API best practice

Some of the best practics for implmenting REST API are following:

<ul>
    <li>Accept and response with JSON </li>
    <li>When returing error, use HTTP error codes and reason for fail </li>
    <li>Use plural when you naming collection of data </li>
    <li>Use resource nesting </li>
    <li>Secure API and use SSL/TLS </li>
    <li>Write documentation and explain what is expected behavior </li>

</ul>

## Scaling

Scalability describes systems ability to be elastic, not just grow as it is usually said.

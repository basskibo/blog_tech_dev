## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a modern landing page using React and a particle effect background. We'll use the react-tsparticles library to add a dynamic and interactive particle effect to our landing page background.

## Particle Background Component
### Prerequisite
As always first thing we need to do is to install dependencies necessary for particles to work. We need <Adjusted>react-tsparticle</Adjusted> as well as <Adjusted>tsparticles-slim</Adjusted> on which <Adjusted>react-tsparticles</Adjusted> is dependent on.
```
npm install react-tsparticles
npm i tsparticles-slim
```
### Setting up
First, let's create a reusable component for the particle background. We'll use the Particles component from the react-tsparticles library. Here's how you can set up the Particle Background component:

```javascript
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import Particles from "react-tsparticles";
import { loadSlim } from "tsparticles-slim";

const ParticlesBackground = () => {
    const particlesInit = useCallback(async (engine) => {
        await loadSlim(engine);
    }, []);

    const particlesLoaded = useCallback(async (container) => {
        await console.log(container);
    }, []);

    return (
        <Particles
            id="tsparticles"
            init={particlesInit}
            loaded={particlesLoaded}
            options={{
                // Customize particle options here
            }}
        />
    );
};

export default ParticlesBackground;
```
Good thing with react-tsparticles is that it is really configurable, so you can set it up by your needs and preferences. For all available options you can refer to its <Link href="https://particles.js.org/docs/interfaces/tsParticles_Engine.Options_Interfaces_IOptions.IOptions.html" >documentation</Link> where it all described pretty much in details so i wont go further into details.

## Integrating Particle Background into the Landing Page
Now, let's integrate the Particle Background component into our landing page. We'll add it as the background of a section in our landing page layout:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ParticlesBackground from "./ParticlesBackground";

const LandingPage = () => {
    return (
        <div className='bg-gradient-to-b from-neutral-900  to-[#7928ca] '>
            <ParticlesBackground />
            <div className=' text-slate-200 md:px-10 px-5 '>
                {/* Content for the landing page */}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default LandingPage;
```

## Before and After

### Before
Before implementation of particles, as you can see it, landing page is pretty minimalistic, gradient background and some text.

/>

### After
So you can see difference between landing with and without particles, it looks more modern and more cool in my opinion.

## Conclusion
With the react-tsparticles library, we can easily add dynamic and interactive particle backgrounds to our React applications. This adds a modern and visually appealing touch to our landing pages, making them stand out and engage users effectively. Feel free to customize the particle options to fit your design requirements and create stunning landing pages for your projects.

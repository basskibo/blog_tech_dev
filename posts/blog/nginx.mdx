publishedAt: "2022-12-17"
excerpt: "In JavaScript, you can use the export keyword to make values and functions available for use in other files. There are two ways to use export: as a named export or as a default export."

## Introduction






Round Robin (round-robin):

Algorithm: Requests are distributed in a circular order to each server.
Use Case: It provides a simple and fair distribution of requests across servers but doesn't take server load or response times into account.

IP Hash (ip_hash):
Algorithm: Assigns requests to upstream servers based on the client's IP address. This ensures that requests from the same IP address are consistently routed to the same server.
Use Case: Useful when maintaining session state on the server is important, such as for applications with user sessions.

Weighted Round Robin (weight):
Algorithm: Servers are assigned weights that determine the proportion of requests they receive. Servers with higher weights get more requests.
Use Case: Use this when you want to distribute the load unevenly based on server capacity. For example, a server with higher capacity gets a higher weight.

Weighted Least Connections (least_conn with weights):
Algorithm: Similar to least_conn, but servers are assigned weights to account for their capacity. It combines least connections with a weighted approach.
Use Case: Suitable when you want to distribute the load based on both server capacity and current connections.

Least Time (least_time):
Algorithm: Routes requests to the server with the lowest average response time. It considers server response times when distributing traffic.
Use Case: Ideal for applications where server response time is a critical factor in load balancing.

Random (random):
Algorithm: Selects an upstream server randomly for each request.
Use Case: Random load balancing can be useful in scenarios where you don't require specific distribution patterns, and you want a simple way to distribute requests across servers.

Hash (hash):
Algorithm: Requests are consistently routed to specific servers based on a hash of the request, such as the URL or another attribute.
Use Case: Useful for maintaining session affinity or distributing traffic based on specific characteristics of the request.

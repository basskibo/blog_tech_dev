## Introduction

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

## What are Variables?

Variables are used to store data values. For example, a variable may be used to store a user’s email address, or their name. In JavaScript, a variable can contain any types of data, such as a string, a true or false boolean, an object, or a number.
Before the ES6 specification was released, there was one way to declare a variable in JavaScript: var. The var keyword can be used to declare a variable that is accessible throughout a program, and can be changed.

### Var, Let, and Const Variables

There are three different keywords used to declare a variable in JavaScript. These are: var, let, and const.

Here is a table that breaks down the differences between these three types of variables:

Keyword Variable Scope Reassign? Redeclare? Hoist?
var Function Yes Yes Yes
const Block Yes No No
let Block No No No
The following are general rules of thumb for using these types of variables:

Use const as much as possible, unless you need to redeclare or hoist a variable.
Use let if you are working with loops.
Only use var if:
You are working on legacy code,
You need a variable that you can redeclare, or
You need a variable accessible everywhere in the program (i.e., globally).
If you’re interested in learning more about these variable types, check out our tutorial on how to use the JavaScript let variable here.

### Scope

Scope is used to refer to where a variable can be accessed within a program. There are two scopes in JavaScript: global scope, which is where a variable is declared outside a block of code; and local scope, which is where a variable is declared inside a block of code

### Hoisting Variables

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used, which means that you can use a variable before it has been declared. This behavior is referred to as hoisting.

## JavaScript design patterns

A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design - in our case - in writing JavaScript web applications.
Another way of looking at patterns are as templates for how we solve problems - ones which can be used in quite a few different situations.

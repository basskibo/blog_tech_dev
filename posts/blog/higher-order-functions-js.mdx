## Introduction

Classes are template used for creating objects, encapsulating data with code to work on that data.
Class in Javascript is built on prototype but also it has some syntax that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantic.
In the modern JavaScript, there’s a more advanced “class” construct, that introduces great new features which are useful for object-oriented programming.

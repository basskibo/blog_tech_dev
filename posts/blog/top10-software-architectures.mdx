## Introduction

Software architecture patterns plays crucial role in granting ability to system to scale over the time by user's demand gets a significant amount

Just keep **looking**

## What is an Architectural Pattern?

Definition of Architectural pattern according to Wikipedia,

<QouteComponent>
	An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring
	problem in software architecture within a given context. Architectural patterns are
	similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope.
</QouteComponent>
In this article, I will be briefly explaining the following 10 common architectural patterns
with their usage, pros and cons.

## Most Popular Software Architectural Patterns

For more details about every pattern noted below, check this <a href="https://nix-united.com/blog/10-common-software-architectural-patterns-part-1/" >link</a>

### Layered architecture

This pattern can be used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks, each of which is at a particular level of abstraction. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer.
The most commonly found 4 layers of a general information system are as follows.
Presentation layer (also known as UI layer)
Application layer (also known as service layer)
Business logic layer (also known as domain layer)
Data access layer (also known as persistence layer)
Usage
General desktop applications.
E commerce web applications.

Pattern #2: Client-server

Pattern #3: Master-slave

Pattern #4: Pipe-filter

Pattern #5: Broker

Pattern #6: Peer-to-peer (P2P)

Pattern #7: Event-bus pattern

Pattern #8: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Pattern #9: Blackboard

Pattern #10: Interpreter

## Data models

### Entity–relationship model

Main article: Entity–relationship model
In software engineering, an entity–relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity–relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity–relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

### Domain model

Main article: Domain model
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the problem domain). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity–relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

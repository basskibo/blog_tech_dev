## Introduction

The <Adjusted>webOS</Adjusted> TV CLI (Command Line Interface) provides a collection of commands used for creating, packaging, installing, and launching web apps in the command line environment. The CLI allows you to develop and test your app without using a specific IDE.

### Install @webosose/ares-cli

You can run installation via npm by installing npm package of <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webosose/ares-cli">@weboose/ares-cli</Link> by running

```bash
$ npm i @webosose/ares-cli
```

verify installation by running 

```bash
$ ares -V
Version: 2.3.1
```

Note: Node version 10.24.1 to 14.15.1 are recommended.


If that is not working, you can follow <Link href="https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/tools/cli-installation">official guide</Link> for installing ares-cli.  

### Features
With the webOS TV CLI, you can install your apps on a target device, such as the simulator, emulator, or webOS TV device. Besides, you can retrieve, run, terminate, and remove the apps installed on the target device. You can use the CLI during any of the following stages of the development process:

## Commands

Be aware that before using any of commands you need to have ares-cli installed first.
Most important commands that you will need you can find in table below:

<Table header={['Command','Description']} content={[['ares', 'Help menu for using the ares commands'],['ares-generate','Creates a web app from a template.'],
['ares-package','Creates and analyses an app package file.'],['ares-setup-device','Manages the target devices.'],['ares-install','Installs an app on the target device.'],
['ares-launch','Runs or terminates the web app.'],['ares-inspect','Runs the Web Inspector for web app debugging.'],['ares-server','Runs the Web server for testing local app files']]} />

## Set up WebOS project

- Start by generating project

```
ares //check help
ares-generate  ./ares-test-app //generate project in folder ares-test-app
```

- create device
```
> ares-setup-device
name                deviceinfo                connection  profile
------------------  ------------------------  ----------  -------
emulator (default)  developer@127.0.0.1:6622  ssh         ose

** You can modify the device info in the above list, or add new device.
? Select add
? Enter Device Name: webos_simulator
? Enter Device IP address: 127.0.0.1
? Enter Device Port: 22
? Enter ssh user: root
? Enter description: new device
? Select authentication password
? Enter password: [hidden]
? Set default ? Yes
? Save ? Yes
name                       deviceinfo                connection  profile
-------------------------  ------------------------  ----------  -------
webos_simulator (default)  root@127.0.0.1:22         ssh         ose
emulator                   developer@127.0.0.1:6622  ssh         ose
```
- Checkout created device:
```
> ares-setup-device --list
name                       deviceinfo                connection  profile
-------------------------  ------------------------  ----------  -------
webos_simulator (default)  root@127.0.0.1:22         ssh         ose
emulator                   developer@127.0.0.1:6622  ssh         ose
```

## Configuring @webosose/ares-cli with Developer Mode App
This is partially based on: https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/app-test/using-devmode-app/

1.) Install Developer Mode app from Content Store

2.) Enable developer mode, enable keyserver

3.) Download TV's private key: http://TV_IP:9991/webos_rsa and save under $HOME/.ssh

4.) As with any SSH key, restrict its access rights: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/webos_rsa

5.) You can test the key with: ssh-keygen -y -P "PASSPHRASE" -f ~/.ssh/webos_rsa

6.) Configure the device using ares-setup-device (-a may need to be replaced with -m if device named webos is already configured) PASSPHRASE is the 6-character passphrase printed on screen in developer mode app

```bash
ares-setup-device -a webos -i "username=prisoner" -i "privatekey=webos_rsa" -i "passphrase=PASSPHRASE"
 -i "host=TV_IP" -i "port=9922"
```

## Running and installing application on LG TV

When we have our code ready for deploying it to TV, we must first <b>package</b> our project to .ipk file, <b>install</b> that .ipk to TV device and finally we can launch it or inspect it. For this last part you dont need to launch it from terminal you can launch application manually by using TV remote as well, but of course if you want to inspect it and debug application you will need to run command from terminal. Lets go step by step:

<LgList>
<li> 
run ares-package in order to package project

```bash
ares-package ./
```

</li>


<li> 
After ares-package command is finished and we have .ipk file output, we can proceed to install application on TV

```bash
ares-install -d webos com.testwebos.app_1.0.0_all.ipk
```
- Launch  application on TV, -d parameter represent on which device you want to run (in my case device is named webos)

```bash
ares-launch -d webos com.testwebos.app
```
- inspect and debug WebOS application

```bash
ares-inspect -d webos -a com.testwebos.app -v 
```
- After you are done you can close application by running :

```bash
ares-launch -d webos com.testwebos.app -c
```

</li> 

</LgList>


## Conclusion

Here it is, you should have your application started on your TV, so now you can bring your idea to life. Setup of webOS project is straight forward as you can see, if you stuck on some step, and you cannot find solution feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help if I can. When you finish developing your application next step is to go to the <Link href="https://seller.lgappstv.com/seller/main/Main.lge#">LG seller lounge</Link> and register your app after everything is done your app should appear at LG store. I hope I will make post about that as well in the near future, so we can close the whole LG webOS development process circle.

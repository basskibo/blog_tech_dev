## Differences between SQL and NoSQL

The five critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL are:

<ul>
	<li>SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational. </li>
	<li>
		SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL
		databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.{" "}
	</li>
	<li>
		SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally
		scalable.{" "}
	</li>
	<li>
		SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph,
		or wide-column stores.{" "}
	</li>
	<li>
		SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for
		unstructured data like documents or JSON.{" "}
	</li>
</ul>

## SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them

### What are transactions?

<TestComponent>
	A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. A
	transaction is an atomic unit. The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction
	can be either all committed (applied to the database) or all rolled back (undone from
	the database).
</TestComponent>

## NoSQL

Everybody heard at least once that NoSQL databases are non-relational and that does not have any relation between the data, well that is not 100% true. They are able to have relation between the data but in a different way.

### Most popular NoSQL databases

NOTE that this list is not exactly ordered by popularity, there are different metrics for measuring the popularity of a particular database. We will just list the most featured ones.

<ul>
	<li>MongoDB </li>
	<li>Cassandra </li>
	<li>ElasticSearch </li>
	<li>Amazon DynamoDB </li>
	<li>CouchDB </li>
	<li>Redis </li>
	<li>HBase </li>
	<li>RavenDB </li>
</ul>

### Types of NoSQL Databases:

<ul>
	<li>Key-value Pair Based </li>
	<li>Column-oriented Graph </li>
	<li>Graphs based </li>
	<li>Document-oriented </li>
</ul>

### Advantages of MongoDB

Performance Levels
High Speed and Higher Availability
Simplicity
Easy Environment and a Quick Set-up
Flexibility
Sharding
Scalability
Ad-hoc Query Support
Documentation
Technical Support
Disadvantages of MongoDB
Transactions
Joins
Indexing
Limited Data Size and Nesting
Duplicates
High Memory Usage

### What is index in MongoDb?

An index in MongoDB is a special data structure that holds the data of few fields of documents on which the index is created. Indexes improve the speed of search operations in database because instead of searching the whole document, the search is performed on the indexes that holds only few fields.

## What is ORM?

An <b>O</b>bject-<b>R</b>elational <b>M</b>apper provides an object-oriented layer between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages without having to write SQL queries. It standardizes interfaces reducing boilerplate and speeding development time.

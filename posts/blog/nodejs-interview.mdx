## What is Node.js and for what is it used?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the clientâ€™s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

## Why use Node.js?

Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:

It is generally fast
It rarely blocks
It offers a unified programming language and data type
Everything is asynchronous
It yields great concurrency

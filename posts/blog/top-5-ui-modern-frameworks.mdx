## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development,hundred of thousands of websites are being made everyday, due to Forbes [250k+ websites made everyday](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/#:~:text=Every%20day%20sees%20the%20creation,and%20ever%2Dgrowing%20online%20world.) and that is daily number. That being said your website needs to standout, looks modern and cool.

With the rise of modern UI libraries, developers now have access to powerful tools and components that can transform their projects from mundane to mesmerizing.

In this post, we'll check out some of exceptional modern UI libraries I personally like and not used in every other project like MUI, those libaries that standout for me are: Radix, Shadcn, Aceternity, Ripple UI, and Mantine. Each library brings its own unique flair and features to the table, catering to the diverse needs of developers and designers alike.
For me personally Material design is pretty outdated and not that fancy and appealing, thats why i prefer these libaries.

Classes are template used for creating objects, encapsulating data with code to work on that data.
Class in Javascript is built on prototype but also it has some syntax that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantic.
In the modern JavaScript, there’s a more advanced “class” construct, that introduces great new features which are useful for object-oriented programming.

_app.js will contain your whole app, meaning this will be rendered in any page of the project. Eg. if you add a <div>hello world</div> in this file, you will see the Hello World on each and every page of your website. More reading here.

index.js will only be rendered if you access / path of your website. You will use index files whenever you create a new page, for example you want an about page, you will have an about folder containing an index.js, all of this contained in the pages folder. More reading here .

When you are creating your personal website or blog, it is great way to show off your Github profile in a way so other can see what you do and what can you do. If you are writing about some project, for example as I am doing right now, easy solution for you and your reader
is to have some graphical showecase for project which is the link to the repository and code at the same time.
Github user repository component card is my first <Adjusted>npm module</Adjusted> I made and published is bacically React component used for generating card for user's Github profile or repository.

## About module

As you probably know npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
It is pretty easy to use, so if you want to install this npm module it is neccassarry to have npm installed in your system and run command

```bash
npm i github-user-repo-card
```

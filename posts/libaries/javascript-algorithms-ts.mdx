## Introduction

Upgrading Ubuntu OS has not been easier than this. I had need to upgrade multiple Ubuntu machines from 16.04 to 20.04 version.
As you probably know every second number is <b> LTS (Latest stable version) </b> so in order to jump to second LTS you need to install first 18.04 and afterwards
you can install 20.04. So I made this little bash script in order to make my life easier.

## What this bash script do

Basically this script just runs commands needed to upgrade the OS, you will still need to confirm/disaprove prompts that you will get while upgrading.

## Script breakdown

### Updating and upgrading packages

First block of commands are just for updating apt packages and upgrading dist.
It looks something like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

After this block you should need to rebboot your machine, so I made simple prompt which asking you for reboot

```bash
echo -n "Do you want to reboot machine? (y/n) \n"
read answer
if [ "$answer" != "${answer#[Yy]}" ] ;then
    # Reboot machine
    sudo reboot
fi
```

<b>
   <Accent>
      {" "}
      NOTE you will only have to reboot machine in case packages were updated/upgraded
      if not you can just go with no{" "}
   </Accent>
</b>

### Running OS upgrade

After machine is rebooted, you can run this script once again, this time you will not need to reboot the machine again, so when prompted go with <b>no</b>

Next block of commands will run the actual upgrade of the Operating System and it looks like this

```bash

sudo do-release-upgrade -c
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

While installing you will get multiple prompts which you need to answer.
After everything is finished you will get prompt that says that reboot is required so go with <b>yes</b>

### Results output

So finally this bash script will just print your current release version

```bash
cat /etc/os-release  | grep VERSION
lsb_release -a
```

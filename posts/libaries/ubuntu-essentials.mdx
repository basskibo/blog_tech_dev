## Introduction

After every new OS reinstallation you have to do the boring part and install everything from scratch. I have been in situation where I was installing
new Ubuntu environment multiple times per year, so I made myself easier and made a bash script which can do this for me.

## What this bash script do

Basically this script is used for installing applications and services, which I normally use, most of the applications and services are for Developers but it can be opted out if you do not 
want something to be installed. In the script there are blocks of installation commands divided by category, so first utilities and prerequired stuff will be installed.
For example if we have some project on github, which is needed to be downloaded like zsh and ohmyzsh, it is prerequired to install git first so if you want to change script have that in mind.

## Applications and services available
As mentioned above, there are different categories so it is easier to organize, in this current version of the script there are 5 categories.
For the some less know application and services I added link so you can read first before installation and check if you want to use it, I personally think that are great stuff but you dont need to use it if you dont want.

## Script breakdown

### Updating and upgrading packages

First block of commands are just for updating apt packages and upgrading dist.
It looks something like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

After this block you should need to rebboot your machine, so I made simple prompt which asking you for reboot

```bash
echo -n "Do you want to reboot machine? (y/n) \n"
read answer
if [ "$answer" != "${answer#[Yy]}" ] ;then
    # Reboot machine
    sudo reboot
fi
```

<b>
   <Accent>
      {" "}
      NOTE you will only have to reboot machine in case packages were updated/upgraded
      if not you can just go with no{" "}
   </Accent>
</b>

### Running OS upgrade

After machine is rebooted, you can run this script once again, this time you will not need to reboot the machine again, so when prompted go with <b>no</b>

Next block of commands will run the actual upgrade of the Operating System and it looks like this

```bash

sudo do-release-upgrade -c
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

While installing you will get multiple prompts which you need to answer.
After everything is finished you will get prompt that says that reboot is required so go with <b>yes</b>

### Results output

So finally this bash script will just print your current release version

```bash
cat /etc/os-release  | grep VERSION
lsb_release -a
```

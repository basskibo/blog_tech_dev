## Introduction

When I started to learn Next.js, I got overwhelmed with the list of abbreviations that looks similar, I didn't know what it is and what is the difference. It is quite confusing because when using Create React App, we usually only use 1 strategy to fetch data from API which is using `useEffect`.

Next.js has many data fetching strategies. Although initially Next.js was well known to be a Server-Side Rendering Framework, it turns out that Next.js has 4 methods of Data Fetching. Here is the short explanation each so you get familiar with the abbreviation of CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR.

-  CSR - Client-Side Rendering, this is the usual kind of data fetching using `useEffect`, it will fetch the data from the API every single page request on the **client-side** (after the page is rendered, then the function will run).
-  SSR - Server-Side Rendering, will run a **special function** to fetch data from API every page request on the **server-side** (before the page is loaded, that special function will run first, creating a delay, then after that, it will serve the page)**.**
-  SSG - Static Site Generation, will run a **special function** to fetch data **once** when that page builds.
-  ISR â€“ Incremental Static Regeneration, this is a new thing, shortly put, a combination of SSG, and SSR, where it served statically, but at a **certain time and certain condition** that page will rebuild and fetch the data from the API again.

Don't worry if you didn't get that, because I will be explaining it thoroughly, just familiarize the words first.

I mentioned before that there is a special function that will run when using a specific data fetching method. Keep that in mind as I will show you what is that special function.

This code example will fetch a date-time from an API using axios, then render it on the page. It is useful to see the date-time so we can truly know when the API is hit.

## Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

Special Function: `useEffect`

[Demo Site](https://next-render.theodorusclarence.com/render/csr)

### Usage

```tsx
export default function CSRPage() {
   const [dateTime, setDateTime] = React.useState<string>();

   React.useEffect(() => {
      axios
         .get("https://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip")
         .then((res) => {
            setDateTime(res.data.datetime);
         })
         .catch((error) => console.error(error));
   }, []);

   return (
      <main>
         <TimeSection dateTime={dateTime} />
      </main>
   );
}
```

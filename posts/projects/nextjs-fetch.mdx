## Introduction

When I started to learn Next.js, I got overwhelmed with the list of abbreviations that looks similar, I didn't know what it is and what is the difference. It is quite confusing because when using Create React App, we usually only use 1 strategy to fetch data from API which is using `useEffect`.

Next.js has many data fetching strategies. Although initially Next.js was well known to be a Server-Side Rendering Framework, it turns out that Next.js has 4 methods of Data Fetching. Here is the short explanation each so you get familiar with the abbreviation of CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR.

-  CSR - Client-Side Rendering, this is the usual kind of data fetching using `useEffect`, it will fetch the data from the API every single page request on the **client-side** (after the page is rendered, then the function will run).
-  SSR - Server-Side Rendering, will run a **special function** to fetch data from API every page request on the **server-side** (before the page is loaded, that special function will run first, creating a delay, then after that, it will serve the page)**.**
-  SSG - Static Site Generation, will run a **special function** to fetch data **once** when that page builds.
-  ISR – Incremental Static Regeneration, this is a new thing, shortly put, a combination of SSG, and SSR, where it served statically, but at a **certain time and certain condition** that page will rebuild and fetch the data from the API again.

Don't worry if you didn't get that, because I will be explaining it thoroughly, just familiarize the words first.

### Demo

Disclaimer: Revalidate time is set to 20 seconds.

Video Description:

1. At first, it was 16:40:12(PT), and real-time when reloading is 16:40:25(RT) and 16:40:29(RT). In those 2 reload, Preview Time (PT) did not change.
2. Then, when 16:40:32(RT) (20s after initial), reload is done twice, the first time on 16:40:36(RT) and 16:40:40(RT). The Preview Time change to 16:40:37(PT) after the **second reload.**

### Keys to Emphasize

Now, this is might be confusing for you, but here is the key I want you to look at.

1. **When in a 20-second cooldown span–16:40:12(RT) - 16:40:32(RT),** reloading doesn't trigger changes. This is because the page is in a **cooldown** state, as we set on the `revalidate` key.
2. **After the 20-second cooldown–16:40:32(RT),** we did 2 reloads.
   1. First Reload at 16:40:36(RT), we know that it is not on the cooldown state anymore. The first visit after the cooldown state is **off,** is going to trigger **page rebuild**. Page rebuild meaning, only this certain page is going to be rebuild. Not the whole application. The fetch API will run in the background, but there will be **no changes** on the Preview Time
   2. Second Full Reload at 16:40:40(RT), the Preview Time change to 16:40:37(PT). Exactly a second after the page rebuild (which means the rebuild takes about 1s). This second reload is going to serve that rebuilt page from the previous reload.

Note:

1. **The first reload does not have to be a full reload**, we can go back to the home page, then to that page again (revisit), it will trigger the rebuild as long as we are not in the cooldown state.
2. **But, the second reload must be a full reload.** Going back to the home page, then to the page again won't change the new Preview Time.

Now, this is a case where we are assuming that only 1 person is accessing the website. But, that reloads will happen **every person** visit while still respecting the cooldown state.

### Is it going to be rebuilt every 20s then?

**Nope.**

When the cooldown is off, if no one visits the page, then that page **will not rebuild**, even after long past the 20s.

But, the **first** person that visits when the **cooldown state is off**, is going to **trigger a rebuild.** That person won't be seeing changes. But, the changes will be served for **the next full reload**.

That's all, folks!
